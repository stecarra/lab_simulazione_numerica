NSL exercises

All c++ and python code uploaded to this repo has been run and worked.

Re-running notebook cells or c++ executables may lead to different output than the present ones: at the time they were run input parameters and code was set right, but there is no guarantee it has since remained the same, as the same code could have been later used for other tasks.
Output files have been overloaded and python scripts need the right specific environment set up to work properly and produce the right output, moreover input parameters have been modified on the go:

to prevent loss of results ==> avoid running cells.

All exercise folders contain one .ipynb notebook where the results of the exercises are displyed and commented (N.B. only exercise 12 has 3 different notebooks one for each point of the exercise)
